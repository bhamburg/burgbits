*Ludwig and my 1969 Vegavox IV*

## Family

My wife Andrea and I reside in Northeast Philly with our twin girls, Elizabeth and Louise. We have a 3-year-old labraheeler named Ludwig. The girls are really enjoying 3rd grade and keeping busy with activities like drama club, singing lessons, and dance. We have no intentions of leaving the area because of the need to stay close to extended family and a tight-knit community of friends here in the Greater Philadelphia region.

## Work

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer for The Walt Disney Company, working out of the New York City office. My team is responsible for providing the control plane software that our media distribution engineers use to configure video streaming servers. It's exciting to get a chance to hone my skills with frontend frameworks like Vue.js while presenting large, complex sets of data and actions, ideally in a clear and concise way.

## Fun

Banjo, books, and video games are my favorite pastimes outside of coding. You can always see the latest books I've read and games I've played on my [shelves](/shelves) page. On New Years Day, I performed with the Fralinger String Band in the Mummers Parade. Our 2025 show, entitled [Junkyard Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfvkHlMTdGs){:target="_blank"}, was awarded third prize.

Experiencing the community come together around the Eagles' Super Bowl victory was amazing. The second time is truly sweeter. Go Birds! ðŸ¦…
