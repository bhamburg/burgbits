## Family

My wife Andrea and I reside in Northeast Philly with our twin girls, Elizabeth and Louise. We have a 3-year-old labraheeler named Ludwig. The girls are doing great in 3rd grade and keeping busy with activities like drama club, singing lessons, and dance. We have no intentions of leaving the area because of the need to stay close to extended family and a tight-knit community of friends here in the Philadelphia area. Go Birds! ðŸ¦…

## Work

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer for [Oncourse Home Solutions](https://www.oncoursehome.com){:target="_blank"} and I commute to the Mount Laurel, NJ office in a hybrid work arrangement. I'm constanly working to keep my tech skills sharp but most recently have been working to be a subject matter expert on frameworks like Next.js (React), and Nuxt.js (Vue), the latter of which I've very recently rebuilt this site to use.

## Fun

Banjo, books, and video games are my favorite outlets when I'm not working. I'm also doing a rewatch of the entire Star Wars saga available on Disney+. You can always see the latest books I've read and games I've played on my [shelves](/shelves) page.

This New Year's Day I will be participating in my 24th Mummers Parade with my 22nd consecutive suit playing banjo in [Fralinger String Band](https://www.fralinger.org){:target="_blank"}. Really looking forward to showing you what we've come up with this year!
